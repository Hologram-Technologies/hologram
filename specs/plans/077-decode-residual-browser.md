# Plan 077: Decode Residual (Browser) — wasm int8 GEMV and the Path to Stream Bandwidth

## Context

hologram-ai's deployed browser decode (0.5B int8, wasm SIMD128, single 32-bit
heap) attributes its residual upstream: a seq-1 pass streams ~0.3 GB of
weights at ~7 MB/s effective against calibrated stream bandwidth in the GB/s
range. The kernel is compute-bound, not bandwidth-bound. Grounded at hologram
HEAD `a912335`, hologram-ai HEAD `8c6402a`; ordered by leverage.

hologram does not benchmark in the browser. **Acceptance for every item is
witnessed downstream by hologram-ai's performance contract** (target lane
ratio, deployed headless-Chromium journey), which exercises the actual wasm
SIMD128 code. hologram-local runs (native, qemu-aarch64, wasmtime) are
iteration signals and regression mirrors only.

**Constraint (κ-operation).** Every item stays within k-operation. Layouts,
tables, and plans are derived content under their own κ (derivation-keyed,
re-derivable, fail-closed); kernels execute over materialized κ content with
deterministic reduction order so CE derivation keys stay valid; no item
introduces a classical fallback tier.

## Phase 1 — items 1, 2, 9 (DONE)

### Item 1: wasm int8 GEMV — weight layout and integer accumulation

The prior `matmul_i8_pc_wasm` walked `bq[kk*n + j]` k-inner with 16-column
tiles: stride-n access used 16 of every 64 bytes per line with no line reuse
between tiles at decode shapes, and every product was float (W8A32, via a
10-op i8→i16→i32→f32 widening ladder).

Landed:
- `matmul_i8_pc_omajor` (`hologram-backend::cpu::simd`): GEMV over
  **output-major** `[n,k]` weights (each output's k-vector contiguous),
  per-token symmetric dynamic i8 activation quantization (**W8A8**,
  `scale = max|a|/127`, deterministic trunc-cast rounding), and **exact
  integer accumulation** — wasm `i16x8_extend` + `i32x4_dot_i16x8`, NEON
  `vmull_s8` + `vpadalq_s16`, identical integer function on scalar targets.
  Output is bit-identical across scalar / NEON / wasm (verified under
  qemu-aarch64 and wasmtime in addition to native): integer sums are
  associative, so reduction order cannot perturb CE derivation keys. Exact-i32
  bound `k ≤ mm_act_quant::K_MAX` (~133k) enforced loudly.
- `MatMulDequantCall { bq_omajor, act_quant }`: `bq_omajor` is layout-only and
  **excluded from `op_signature`** (the `b_packed` rule — the operand's κ-label
  reflects its transposed bytes); W8A8 is a different function and takes a
  **new signature tag (116)**, leaving W8A32 signatures byte-identical (no
  re-keying of existing content). Archive wire: new discriminant `D_MMDQ2 =
  116` emitted only when a field is non-default; unchanged compilations stay
  byte-identical, unknown tags fail closed.
- Compile-time fusion pass `fuse_const_i8_decode` (`hologram-compiler`): a
  constant symmetric per-channel i8 weight uniquely consumed by
  `Dequantize → MatMul(B)` at decode shapes (static m ≤ 4) fuses in the
  archive into one `MatMulDequant { bq_omajor, W8A8 }`, with the constant
  transposed `[k,n] → [n,k]` — derived content under its own κ, the quantized
  analog of the f32 panel packing. The fused call is the transposed layout's
  only reader. Dynamic quantized weights keep load-time fusion (W8A32,
  `[k,n]`), which no-ops on already-fused archives; warm-fold is unaffected
  (the fused call has a dynamic input, so it is never a constant-only cone).
- Dispatch (`matmul_dequant_float`): omajor+W8A8 routes to the new kernel on
  **all** targets, fail-closed — no W8A32 downgrade, no `[k,n]`
  misinterpretation possible.

Conformance: `wl2_*` tests prove the fusion fires in the archive, execution is
bit-identical to an independent W8A8 integer reference over the original
`[k,n]` bytes (which also witnesses the transposition), prefill shapes stay on
the runtime W8A32 path, and asymmetric zero-points never take the W8A8 path.

### Item 2: GEMV-specialized dispatch

The omajor kernel is GEMV-shaped by construction: at m = 1 it runs 4 output
rows in flight with independent i32x4 accumulators over contiguous weight
rows, unrolled k, no output tiling; the activation extends amortize over the
rows in flight. Small m (≤ 4) loops rows through the same core.

### Item 9: decode-shaped benches (upstream contract mirror)

- `decode_gemv` criterion bench: m = 1 at deployed projections — 0.5B
  896×896 / 896×4864 / 4864×896, 1.5B 1536×8960, 7B 3584×18944 — reporting
  **bytes of int8 weight streamed per second** for both the omajor W8A8
  kernel and the prior `[k,n]` W8A32 path, plus a full-pipeline
  `session_step_novel` bench (novel input per step so the memo cannot elide
  the kernel — the seq-1 per-op-overhead surface for item 7). Registered in
  `benches/manifest.toml`.
- `wasm_matmul_timing` example extended with the int8 GEMV shapes so the
  wasmtime + simd128 lane exercises the actual wasm kernel.

Iteration signals at landing (not acceptance): wasmtime SIMD128 streams
16–19 GB/s int8 on 0.5B–1.5B shapes vs 3.9–5.9 GB/s for the prior kernel
(~3×), falling to 11.5 GB/s at the 7B shape as the working set leaves cache —
i.e., the kernel is entering the bandwidth-bound regime item 1 targets.
Native x86 (scalar vs scalar) shows ~5× from layout + integer accumulation
alone.

## Item 3: acceptance is witnessed downstream (standing)

Kernel changes are accepted by hologram-ai's performance contract, which is
where the browser exists. hologram's benches catch shape-level regressions
before they reach it.

## Phase 2 — item 4: relaxed SIMD tier (DONE)

Landed as an **exact-only** tier: `gemv_i8_omajor_wasm_relaxed` (built with
`-Ctarget-feature=+simd128,+relaxed-simd`) computes the **same W8A8
function** with `i32x4_relaxed_dot_i8x16_i7x16_add` by splitting the signed
activation row `q = q⁺ − q⁻` with both halves in the i7 range `[0, 127]` —
exactly where the relaxed dot is exact and engine-deterministic (products
≤ 127², internal pairwise i16 sums ≤ 32258 cannot saturate). Each 16-wide
step is two relaxed dots per row instead of two extends + two dots + two
adds, with no activation extends at all. Output stays bit-identical to the
baseline and scalar paths (the exactness suite passes on both builds under
wasmtime), so the tier is a pure execution speedup with zero semantic
surface — no call-surface, signature, codec, or compiler change. The
baseline simd128 build remains the witnessed fallback; `just wasm` builds
both tiers so neither bit-rots.

`f32x4_relaxed_madd` was measured (wasmtime, x86-64 FMA host) and
**regressed the f32 kernels ~30%** — the register-tile accumulator chains
are latency-bound and the fused op lengthens the dependency chain — so it is
deliberately excluded (documented at the wasm_simd module comment). Re-open
only with an in-browser V8 measurement from hologram-ai showing otherwise.

wasmtime relaxed-tier signal: 17.6–19.6 GB/s int8 at cache-resident decode
shapes and 14.5 GB/s at the 7B shape (vs 11.5 baseline, +26%) — the kernel
is bandwidth-limited on this host.

## Phase 3 — item 7 (+ item 8): seq-1 dispatch, fusion, and mathf (IN PROGRESS)

Fixture-scale decode attributes 20–50× floor to per-op overhead at seq = 1.

Landed:
- Fusion pass ordering: dequant→matmul fuses before the matmul epilogue, so
  a dynamic quantized weight followed by an activation keeps streaming in
  place instead of re-materializing the dense f32 weight each step.
- dequant+matmul+bias+activation as ONE call: `MatMulDequantCall` carries a
  fused epilogue (`act`, `residual`) — signature-visible (extended tag),
  wire-carried on the extended discriminant, applied in place at dispatch
  while the `m·n` results are hot. The load-time epilogue pass absorbs
  activation-only, bias-add-only, and the three-op `matmul → add → act`
  chain into fused dequant-matmuls, including archive-carried compile-time
  omajor W8A8 calls. Conformance: `gelu(A·dequant(Bq) + bias)` is one call;
  exact epilogues (relu) stay bit-identical to the W8A8 reference.

Remaining: a pre-bound plan handle keyed by the graph's κ that validates
once and replays per step; arena reuse across steps. The
`decode_gemv/session_step_novel` bench is the measurement surface (baseline:
~84 µs/step over the raw kernel at m = 1, 896×4864, single-op). Item 8 rides
along: SIMD exp for the softmax path (`cpu/mathf.rs` breadth), or the Q-tier
exp table once item 6 lands.

## Phase 4 — item 5: wasm threads

`cpu/parallel.rs` is `std::thread`, compiled out on wasm. Decode GEMV is
row-parallel with zero synchronization inside a step. wasm threads
(SharedArrayBuffer + atomics; hologram-ai serves its own COOP/COEP headers)
need an embedder-provided worker contract; determinism is preserved by static
row partitioning (per-output reduction order unchanged, structural-ce
unaffected). Near-linear scaling until Phase 1's kernel is bandwidth-bound.

## Phase 5 — item 6: Q0/LUT-GEMM tier to main

The kernel-floor tier (fiber-ordered radix passes, one L1 line per pass,
per-element cost = table lookup) exists only as plan 033 on the migration
branch; `cpu/lut.rs` on main is Q1 unary only. This is the structural lever
below item 1's ceiling: it removes the multiply entirely and cuts the
streamed bytes, not just the widening. Sequence after Phases 2–3.
